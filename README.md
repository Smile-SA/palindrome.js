# ** Palindrome.js **

```Palindrome.js``` Ã¬s a ```three.js```` based library which provides a 3D representation for system metrics and KPIs, presented as sets within layers, to easily identify relations in behaviors or trends evolutions for your realtime systems. Custom algorithms, behaviors, styles and color schemes can easily be modified or added. 

*```Palyndrome.js``` is still considered as an experimental / beta prototype, feedbacks are welcome !*

### Motivation

Idea behind this project is to go one step further in current monitoring and dashboarding solutions, by enabling a scalable, user oriented, single view for multi-dimensional or heterogeneous sets of data points. Use cases are various, from comparing system metrics to external indicators, to stacking up multi-tenancy informations groups for measuring differences or similarities. ```Palyndrome.js``` can both be used as a live UI component for a larger BI dashboard, or as the signal source for a computer-vision based workflow.

## Tech/framework used
Project is created with:

* Three.js
* love

## Setup
This project uses ```yarn``` as the dependency manager, ```parcel-bundler``` as the packager, ```three.js``` as its 3D renderer and ```storybook``` for functional testing. 

```
yarn install
```

Then, run ```storybook``` for an interactive session :

```
yarn storybook
```

*If for some reason the ```knobs``` panel isn't showing up, open your  browser developer console and type ```localStorage.clear()```*

Or alternatively run the default local session :

```
yarn dev
```
