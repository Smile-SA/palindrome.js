# ** 3D resprentation of Metric System **

This project aims to display 3D representation of metric system, where you can add different sets of metrics with some definition and analyze behavior/functionality with time series.

// ### Motivation

// Idea behind this project is to optimize throughput and based on relation defined for metrics you can continously optimize, predict and plan your project/system/resources.

## Tech/framework used
Project is created with:

* Three.js
* CSS2DRender.js

## Setup
To run this project first install npm or yarn, I prefer yarn:

On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Yarn via Debian package repository
```
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
```

Then you can simply:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```

Here also I used *Parcel Bundler* web application bundler.
First install Parcel using Yarn:

```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

Create a package.json file in your project directory using:
```
yarn init
```
fill in the details about your project and install dependencies:
```
yarn add three
yarn add three-css2drender
```
Adding parcel  bundler to your project:

```
yarn add parcel-bundler --dev
```

Then, add these tasks scripts to your project, by modifying your package.json:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "parcel <your entry file>",
    "build": "parcel build <your entry file>"
  }
}
```



Finally You will require .JSON file to fetch data (metrics). This file is required before running the program, so add the path of your data in the code.
An example of data structure is shown below:

### Code Example
```
{
    "systemMetrics":
        {
            "throughput" : {
                "label" : "CPU",
                "unit" : "cycle / seconds",
                "min" : 1000,
                "med" : 5000,
                "max" : 10000,
                "current" : 3900
            },
            "availability" : {
                "label" : "RAM",
                "unit" : "GB",
                "min" : 160,
                "med" : 640,
                "max" : 1280,
                "current" : 480
            }
        }
}
```
Then, you will be able to run the program using:
```
yarn dev
```
